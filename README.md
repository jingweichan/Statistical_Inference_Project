# Statistical Inference Project

In this project, we will investigate the exponential distribution in R and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem. The exponential distribution can be simulated in R with rexp(n, lambda) where lambda is the rate parameter. The mean of exponential distribution is 1/lambda and the standard deviation is also 1/lambda. lambda is set to 0.2 for all of the simulations. The distribution of averages of 40 exponentials will be investigated and a thousand simulations will be performed.

In the second portion of the project, we are going to analyze the ToothGrowth data in the R datasets package.
